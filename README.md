WHAT TO DO >

1. Create 2 separate branches off of the main branch
    a) Name one branch "<YOUR FIRST NAME>1". Make sure you have a file Story.txt.
    b) Name the other "<YOUR FIRST NAME>2". Make sure you have a file Story.txt.

2a. Check out the repo for any branches that have already been created by other members.
    THIS IS IMPORTANT because you'll need to see which words have already been used.

2b. Check out the Dictionary.txt file on the main branch for translations to the German words provided by the instructor.

2c. Compose two sentences following the guidelines on the IceBreaker Assignment document in Part 1: Story Time, Step 2  
    Parts a) and b) can be done locally or directly on the repo. 
     a) Add your first sentence to Story.txt in your first branch
     b) Add your second sentence to Story.txt in your second branch

3. Make sure git is set up on your computer so you can push your sentences onto our main Story.txt file during the meeting.
    
That's it. We'll put the story together during the meeting, as mentioned above.
