Dazed in a Kopfikino, I looked to my right.
I knew the Brot was bad; why did I eat it?
So I got in my BMW to go home and noticed the Klimaanlage wasn't working.
I had this Schnapsidee that my stomache would be okay, even though it was a hot day.
I realized I had been snapped back to reality by the air blowing from a Klimaanlage.
I reoriented myself back onto the Hauptsrasse.
